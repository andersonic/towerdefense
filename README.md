# Tower Defense
Tower defense game by Jun Ru Anderson and Alice Yao. Defend your tower from attackers with limited resources. Choose a combination of land and naval units for defense.

## To play
Download the runnable jar file and run it! You need Java to do this.
The two units in the bottom-right corner are defensive units. Build more by dragging and dropping the units from the bottom-right to other spaces. But remember, land units can't be placed in water, and naval units can't be placed on land!

## Built with
Java
